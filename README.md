## Jonah Spear and Carl Moser

Our project idea is modifying the neato so that it can draw images using dots. This spans the range of low level (creating a pen actuator node on the neato) to high level (path planning and precise odometry).

We've been busy implementing a few key features that will be used in the final design.
